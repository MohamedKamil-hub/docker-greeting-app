# docker-greeting-app

the project idea is  from 

https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-dockerfile 

just a simple Docker project that demonstrates how to create a custom image based on Alpine Linux. The container greets with a customizable message.

## Project Goals

This project was built as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of creating a `Dockerfile`. The goals were:
- To create a Dockerfile using `alpine:latest` as the base image.
- To have the container print "Hello, [name]!" to the console upon execution.
- To implement an advanced feature allowing the greeting name to be customized at runtime.
